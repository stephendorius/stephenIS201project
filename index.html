            <p class="center"> <span class="bold">History of BYU Football</span>:BYU football began in 1922, but for its first several decades, the program saw little national success. Competing in the Rocky Mountain Conference and later the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), the Cougars often had losing seasons and struggled to gain recognition. Facilities, recruiting, and funding were all limited compared to more established programs. BYU football remained relatively obscure through the mid-20th century, without any major bowl appearances or conference championships to speak of.</p>
            <p class="center">That all changed in 1972 when LaVell Edwards was hired as head coach. Edwards implemented a pass-heavy offense that revolutionized college football, particularly in an era dominated by run-first teams. His bold strategy led to immediate success and put BYU on the national map. The team won its first WAC title in 1974 and became known for producing high-powered offenses and prolific quarterbacks. Under Edwards, BYU won a total of 19 conference championships and developed a national following.</p> 
            <p class="center">The pinnacle of BYU football came in 1984, when the team went 13–0 and won the national championship, defeating Michigan in the Holiday Bowl. That season, BYU finished ranked No. 1 in the AP and Coaches Polls, the only time the program has claimed a national title. During this era, BYU produced star quarterbacks such as Jim McMahon, Steve Young, and Ty Detmer. Detmer went on to win the Heisman Trophy in 1990, further cementing BYU’s reputation as “Quarterback U.”</p> 
            <p class="center">After LaVell Edwards retired in 2000, the program entered a more inconsistent period. Head coaches Gary Crowton and later Bronco Mendenhall had mixed success. Mendenhall, however, helped stabilize the team and led BYU to multiple 10-win seasons and bowl appearances. In 2011, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and became independent in football, seeking more flexibility in scheduling and national exposure. This change came with challenges, including tougher competition and no automatic bowl tie-ins.</p> 
            <p class="center">Under Kalani Sitake, who became head coach in 2016, BYU experienced a resurgence. The highlight came in 2020, when the Cougars went 11–1 during a COVID-affected season and finished ranked No. 11 in the country. Quarterback Zach Wilson emerged as a star and was later drafted No. 2 overall in the NFL Draft. Sitake's leadership emphasized physical play, cultural identity, and player development, helping BYU stay relevant on the national stage despite the challenges of independence.</p> 
            <p class="center">In 2023, BYU officially joined the Big 12 Conference, marking a major milestone for the program. The move brought increased visibility, tougher competition, and the chance to recruit at a higher level. Joining a Power Five conference also gave BYU a clear path to participate in the College Football Playoff system and compete for conference titles. While early seasons in the Big 12 have been a learning experience, the program is poised for long-term growth as it adapts to its new environment and builds on its storied legacy.</p>
